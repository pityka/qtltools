HOW TO BUILD
============

Build for linux on centos7 with the provided Makefile. 

1) docker build .  # will print the image hash
2) docker run -it -v `pwd`:/opt IMAGEHASH /bin/bash -c 'cd /opt && make -f Makefile.static'
3) you can remove the image if you want, the binary is in bin/

Most of the dependencies are statically linked except libm and libpthread.
